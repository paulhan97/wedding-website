                        <p>En route to arrivals, complementary transfers from Kona International Airport to the Mauna Lani Resort will be offered throughout <b>Wednesday, December 11</b> and <b>Thursday, December 12</b>.</p>
                        <p>En route to departures, transfers from the Mauna Lani Resort to Kona International Airport will be offered on <b>Sunday, December 15</b>.</p>
                        <p>For those looking to use the complementary transfers, we will request for your flight information as the wedding date approaches to help arrange transportation.</p>
                        <p>Once guests arrive at the Mauna Lani, there is a shuttle that takes passengers to various stops within the resort premises.</p>
                        <p>The primary transportation option to and from parts of the island will be via rental car, which each guest party will have to arrange independently. Rideshare options (Uber, Lyft, etc.) are heavily limited. If you would like to use a rental car during your stay, please reserve the car ahead of time and take note that the Mauna Lani charges a $40 per night parking fee.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Because the venue has regulations regarding the maximum number of ceremony attendees allowed on the beach at one-time, we have regrettably opted to exclude +1s.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Any guest is, of course, free to explore Big Island (or any of the other Hawaiian islands) before the Welcome Event and after the Wedding Reception.</p>
                        <p>During the peak days of the wedding, the bulk of the events will take place in the afternoon/evening. Therefore, guests are free to explore the Big Island so long as they plan to be well on-time for the wedding events.</p>
